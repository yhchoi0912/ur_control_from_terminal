[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findget_program_state.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "get_program_state", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "get_program_state"
  with any of the following names:

    get_program_stateConfig.cmake
    get_program_state-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "get_program_state" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "get_program_state_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "get_program_state" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
